        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>1 teaspoon kosher salt</p></li>
            <li><p>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p></li>
            <li><p>¼ cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces</p></li>
            <li><p>1 tablespoon honey</p></li>
            <li><p>vegetable oil</p></li>
            <li><p>1 (6 ounce) package cooked chicken, shredded, or to taste</p></li>
            <li><p>½ (8 ounce) package Monterey Jack cheese, sliced, or to taste</p></li>
            <li><p>½ avocado, sliced, or to taste</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Bring milk to a simmer in a pot. Remove from heat and stir in butter.</p></li>
            <li><p>Combine arepas flour, grated Monterey Jack cheese, kosher salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Add the hot milk mixture and honey; stir until combined. Let mixture sit until milk is absorbed enough for a soft dough to form, 1 to 2 minutes. Dough will continue to stiffen.</p></li>
            <li><p>Form dough into 12 balls about 2 inches in diameter. Flatten between palms into 3 1/2- to 4-inch arepa patties about 1/3-inch thick.</p></li>
            <li><p>Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Fry 3 to 4 arepas at a time until lightly golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Slice each arepa in half crosswise and stuff a portion of chicken, sliced Monterey Jack cheese, and avocado between the halves.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Cook's Note:</h2>
